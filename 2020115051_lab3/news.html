        <h3>Nepal stares at Covid abyss as cases skyrocket</h3>
        <div>
            <img class="articleimgl" src="h3.jpg" alt="h2" />
        <p class="l">
            1200% — this is the rate at which Covid-19 infections have risen in Nepal in just a matter of weeks.

Last month, the little Himalayan nation that has around 31 million people was reporting just about 100 cases a day. Now, that figure is slowly nearing the 10,000-mark. The country is reporting about 20 cases per 100,000 people a day — numbers that are similar to what India was reporting a week back.

        <h3>Free IAS Prelims study material for all IAS aspirants amidst covid crisis by Rau’s IAS</h3>
        <div>
            <img class="articleimgr" src="h4.jpg" alt="h2" />
        <p class="r">
            Majority of the serious IAS aspirants follow the same set of reference books; they read the same newspapers and follow a good monthly current affairs magazine. However, many aspirants still fail to crack the UPSC Prelims exam? Why?

            The reason is inadequate and improper revision of the vast civil services Prelims syllabus all aspirants cover over the course of their preparation.
